        My name is Steven Pennington and I initially grew up in southern
        California, and have traveled around the United States for school and
        work. Growing up I have always enjoyed learning how things work. This
        drive led me into my first career as a scientist. I went to school to
        study Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and ended up getting my Ph.D.
        in 2009 from Oklahoma State University. From there I went to the
        University of Iowa where I spent 4 years as a postdoctoral fellow doing
        research. Several of my projects have had a bioinformatics aspect to
        them and this was my initial foray into coding. I had to teach myself
        Python to pursue my degree and I have used it in several projects since.
        I also have some experience with R for analysing large data sets. During
        and after my postdoc I also taught at several colleges, As Flash was
        fazed out I volunteered to make new virtual labs in early 2020. A sample
        of this can be found on this web site. Once COVID-19 hit the world
        enrollment fell and I found myself with less work. This abundant amount
        of free time led me to the opportunity that is
        <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/">Tech Elevator</a> where I
        furthered my programming skills substantially and developed many great
        relationships along the way. Upon graduation from Tech Elevator I began
        working there as an Academic Fellow, helping students and developing
        tech for the company.

        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
        has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
        over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
        Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
        Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
        the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
        undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33
        of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by
        Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
        ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem
        Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section
        1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is
        reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from
        "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their
        exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914
        translation by H. Rackham.

        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
        since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
        centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
        of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
        with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
        of Lorem Ipsum
